# Testing Instructions for Polling App

This document provides instructions on how to run the tests for the login functionality of the polling app.

## Test Setup

Before running the tests, make sure you have the required dependencies installed:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/react @testing-library/user-event jest jest-environment-jsdom
```

## Running the Tests

You can run the tests using the following commands:

### Run all tests
```bash
npm test
```

### Run specific tests
```bash
npx jest __tests__/auth/login-simple.test.tsx
```

### Run with verbose output
```bash
npx jest --verbose
```

### Run with watch mode (continuous testing)
```bash
npx jest --watch
```

## Test Files

The login functionality tests are located in:
- `__tests__/auth/login-simple.test.tsx`: Basic tests for login functionality
- `__tests__/auth/login-manually-improved.test.tsx`: Enhanced tests with more detailed assertions

## Test Reflection

For a detailed reflection on the testing process and improvements made to the AI-generated tests, see the `REFLECTION.md` file.

## Screenshots

To complete the assignment, run the tests and capture a screenshot of the passing tests or coverage report. You can generate a coverage report using:

```bash
npx jest --coverage
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues running the tests:

1. Make sure all dependencies are installed correctly
2. Check that the test configuration in `jest.config.js` is correct
3. Verify that the mock implementations for Next.js router and Supabase are properly set up
4. Ensure that the `jest.setup.js` file has the correct imports and configurations

Happy testing!
